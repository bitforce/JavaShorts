# Java Shorts

Overview
---
A collection of different Java programs/functionality that don't necessarily 
count as their own indivudal projects. Each one is runnable within it's 
own directory and has a README detailing its use. Many of these 
programs serve as building-blocks and/or references for other 
software I develope. 

The reason I call them _shorts_ is because the type of work reminds me of 
short films.
